# Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
Here I have workd with a simple **Bangla text** using **Bangla NLTK**. Banglanltk is a python package for Bengali Natural Language Processing.  
Explored different Libraries like **word_tokenaizer, sent_tokenizer (sentence tokenizer), stemmer** etc.  
Discussed about some differences in stemmer and Lemmatization  
and Using Counter Vetorizer creat bag of words for the Begali Text.
